Description: This package implements the Two Stage Curvature Identification using Random Forest and Basis Approach proposed in <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12808>. It constructs the esimator of causal effect using instrumental variable(IV) in the presence of invalid IVs. An IV strength test and the violastion space selection for the IVs are implemented and we further constrcut the confidence interval for the causal effect.
