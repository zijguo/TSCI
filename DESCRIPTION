Description: This package implements the Two Stage Curvature Identification using Random Forests and Basis Approach proposed in <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12808>. 
It constructs the esimator of the causal effect even if all IVs are possibly invalid. An IV strength test and the violastion form selection are implemented.
